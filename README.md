TTTRSS
======

This is a fork of the original [Tiny Tiny RSS](git@github.com:theScrabi/tttrsss.git) app for android.
Due to incompatibility with fdroid this fork was produced. However only a few changes where made
to allow this app to be distributed on fdroid.

Since this version does not need to be bough I highly recommend to [donate](https://tt-rss.org/) to them,
or buy the [unlock key](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.fox.ttrss.key&hl=de) on google play.
